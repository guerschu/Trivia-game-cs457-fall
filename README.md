2. **Connect clients:** Run the `client.py` client is going to take three inputs from terminal 'host IP address' 'port number' 'which trivia you would like to load' 'value'
3. **Pick Trivia:** We only have 'animal' trivia as an option, more soon to come to pick to be able to have a variety of fun trivia options
