We wanted to make a fun terminal co-op game where you and your friends can test your Trivia knowledge!

**How to play:**
1. **Start the server:** Run the `server.py` script. 'IP' 'Port number'
2. **Connect clients:** Run the `client.py` client is going to take three inputs from the terminal 'host IP address' 'port number' 'trivia' 'what kind of trivia you would like to play' 'the player name for the game'
3. **Pick Trivia:** We only have 'animal' trivia as an option, more soon to come to pick to be able to have a variety of fun trivia options
