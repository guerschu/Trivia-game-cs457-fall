Statement of Work

# Trivia
* Trivia Co-op Game

# Team:
* Alberto Marmolejo-Daher
* Mallory Guerdet-Schuster

# Project Objective
* We want to make a game where people will be able to play against someone else to see if they have what it takes to be the next best trivia all-star! We want to be able to keep track of points and let those who are winning know, it will be based on how correct the answers are.  

# Scope:
## Inclusions:
*List the specific tasks, features, or components that will be included in the project*
1. client
2. second client
3. server
4. be able to keep scores
5. update player on scores between rounds

## Exclusions:
*List any tasks, features, or comments that will not be included in the project*
1. no points based on who gets the correct answer faster
   

# Deliverables:
*[List the expected outputs or deliverables from the project, such as a working Python script, documentation, or presentations.]*
1. Would like to have the questions printed to screen along with the choices
2. the correct answer at the end of a limited amount of time
3. the player's scores after that before the next question
4. being able to keep a running score of players' scores to see who will win
5. announce the winner in the end and thank them for playing
6. being able to have a random way to get the questions


# TimeLine

## Key Milestones:
| Info | Dates | Is It Done |
|------|------|---------|
| sprint 0 |  09/22/24  |  Done! |
| sprint 1 |  10/06/24  |  -- |
| sprint 2 |  10/20/24  |  -- |
| sprint 3 |  11/03/24  |  -- |
| sprint 4 |  11/17/24  |  -- |
| sprint 5 |  12/06/24  |  -- |

## Task Breakdowns:
| Task | details | estimate of length of time to complete |
|-----|---|------|
|Setting up the python classes |creating the files for the clients and servers |2|
| writing the code for the client| This would be to set up one client to connect with the server | 3|
| setting up the server | this would involve setting up the server to connect to client| 3|
|setting up questions | getting a good list of questions and keeping track of the correct answers | 3|
| coding how to keep track of the scores | this will probably be in multiple parts of how to get the scores, update them, keep track of what score belongs to who, and displaying them| 5|


# Technical Requirements

## Hardware
*[Specify any hardware requirements, such as servers, networking equipment, or specific devices.]*
*

## Software
*List the necessary software tools, programming languages (Python), libraries (socket, threading, etc.), and operating systems.*
* We will be using Visual Studio Code in Python
* standard Libraries as of now, including sockets, threading, and more.

# Assumptions:
*State any assumptions that are being made about the project, such as network connectivity or availability or resources*
* Current assumptions are that there will be one or two players connected to one server, and that a server will be readily available to the client

# Roles and Responsibilities:
* *Define team members' roles, including project manager, developers, testers, etc., and their responsibilities.*
* There are two current team members. Both team members will perform agile based testing while continuously integrating tests for the code
# Communication Plan:
* *Outline the communication channels and frequency for project updates, meetings, and decision-making.*
* Both team members communicate via MS Teams and will base the project in agile based project management, using scrums to organize each sprint.
# Additional Notes:
* *Include any other relevant information or consideration that are specific to your project*
* This projects scope has been based around the availabilty and bandwidth of both team members
